# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project was to perform the ETL pipeline on a given dataset. We were expected to clean and transform the data, and use it to answer questions provided. This tested our knowledge of SQL and database practices.

## Process
### Clean and transform data
- null values and redundant data were removed
- extrapolated missing data
- created relationships between tables
- used QA techniques to ensure data integrity

### Use the data to answer questions
- used queries to find trends in the newly cleaned and transformed data
- used these trends to answer questions about the business

## Results
I was able to clean the data and glean information about products, sales, customers and marketing channels. Using this, I was able to see trends in each of those categories to answer the questions.

## Challenges 
The data was extremely messy, and a lot of it was unrelatable. This took a lot of time to clean and parse.

## Future Goals
Even though it was beyond the scope of the project, I would like to figure out if it is possible to get the dataset to the 2nd normal form.
